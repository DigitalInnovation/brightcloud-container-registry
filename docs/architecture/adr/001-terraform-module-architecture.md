# ADR-001: Terraform Module Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The BrightCloud Container Registry platform needs a scalable, maintainable Terraform architecture that supports multiple environments, team-based access control, and enterprise security requirements while conforming to M&S Technology Standards.

## Decision

We will implement a modular Terraform architecture with the following design principles:

### 1. Module Structure
- **Core Modules**: `acr-registry`, `acr-rbac`, `acr-network`, `acr-monitoring`
- **Composite Modules**: High-level modules that combine core modules
- **Environment Configurations**: Environment-specific configurations using module composition

### 2. Input Validation Strategy
- **Comprehensive Validation**: All input variables must have validation blocks
- **Security-First Defaults**: Secure defaults for all security-related parameters
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Validation rules that enforce business and compliance requirements

### 3. State Management
- **Remote Backend**: All environments use remote state storage
- **State Isolation**: Each environment maintains separate state files
- **State Locking**: Concurrent modification protection enabled

### 4. Module Versioning
- **Semantic Versioning**: All modules follow semver for releases
- **Pinned Versions**: Environment configurations pin to specific module versions
- **Testing Strategy**: Each module version is thoroughly tested before release

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler to understand, fewer dependencies
- **Cons**: Harder to maintain, test, and reuse across teams

### Micromodules Architecture
- **Pros**: Very granular control, high reusability
- **Cons**: Complex dependency management, over-engineering

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes modules easier to maintain
- **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently
- **Reusability**: Modules can be used across different environments and projects
- **Security**: Consistent security controls across all deployments
- **Compliance**: Built-in compliance with M&S Technology Standards

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More complex than a monolithic approach
- **Learning Curve**: Teams need to understand module interactions
- **Dependency Management**: Requires careful management of module versions

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Module Development
1. Implement `acr-registry` module with comprehensive validation
2. Implement `acr-rbac` module for team-based access control
3. Implement `acr-network` module for private endpoints
4. Implement `acr-monitoring` module for observability

### Phase 2: Environment Integration
1. Create environment-specific configurations
2. Implement CI/CD pipelines for module testing
3. Establish versioning and release process

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add support for cross-region replication
2. Implement advanced monitoring and alerting
3. Add compliance and audit features

## Compliance Notes

This architecture ensures compliance with:
- **M&S Technology Standards**: Terraform as approved IaC tool
- **Security Standards**: Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- **Operational Standards**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Documentation Standards**: All modules fully documented with examples
