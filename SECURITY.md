# Security Policy

## Overview

The BrightCloud Container Registry Platform is designed with security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security guidelines for contributors and users.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Architecture

### Container Registry Security

- **Private Network Access**: All production registries use private endpoints
- **ABAC Permissions**: Repository-scoped access control using Azure ABAC
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrated quarantine policies for automatic security scanning
- **Content Trust**: Docker Content Trust enabled for Premium SKU registries
- **Encryption**: Support for customer-managed keys (CMK) encryption
- **Network Isolation**: VNet integration and network security groups

### GitHub Actions Security

- **OIDC Authentication**: Passwordless authentication using GitHub Actions OIDC
- **Least Privilege**: Actions use minimal required permissions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all action inputs
- **Team Isolation**: Repository-scoped permissions prevent cross-team access
- **Audit Logging**: All promotion activities are logged for compliance

### Infrastructure Security

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources defined in version-controlled Terraform
- **Security Scanning**: Automated scanning with tfsec, Checkov, and Semgrep
- **Secrets Management**: Azure Key Vault integration for sensitive data
- **Resource Tagging**: Comprehensive tagging for compliance and governance
- **State Security**: Terraform state stored in encrypted Azure Storage

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Environment**: Affected versions, configurations, or environments
5. **Mitigation**: Any temporary workarounds or mitigations you've identified

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Triage and Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates until resolution
- **Resolution**: Target resolution within 30 days for critical issues

### Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We coordinate public disclosure with the reporter
5. **Credit**: We provide appropriate credit to reporters (unless anonymity is requested)

## Security Guidelines

### For Contributors

#### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs, especially from external sources
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
- **Logging**: Log security events but never log sensitive data
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed by at least one other team member

#### Infrastructure Security

- **Least Privilege**: Apply principle of least privilege to all resource access
- **Network Security**: Use private networking where possible
- **Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Backup**: Ensure secure backup and disaster recovery procedures

#### Secrets Management

- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit secrets, keys, or passwords to code
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for runtime secrets
- **Key Vault**: Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets
- **Rotation**: Implement regular secret rotation procedures
- **Access Logging**: Log and monitor secret access

### For Users

#### Registry Usage

- **Image Scanning**: Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment
- **Base Images**: Use minimal, updated base images
- **Signed Images**: Use content trust for production deployments
- **Access Control**: Follow principle of least privilege for team access
- **Network Security**: Use private endpoints where possible

#### Authentication

- **OIDC Preferred**: Use OIDC authentication over service principal keys
- **Regular Rotation**: Rotate service principal credentials regularly
- **Scope Limitation**: Limit service principal scope to minimum required
- **Multi-Factor Auth**: Enable MFA for all administrative accounts
- **Access Review**: Regularly review and audit access permissions

#### Deployment Security

- **Secure Pipelines**: Use secure CI/CD pipelines with proper access controls
- **Environment Isolation**: Maintain strict isolation between environments
- **Approval Processes**: Implement approval workflows for production deployments
- **Monitoring**: Monitor deployments for security anomalies
- **Incident Response**: Have incident response procedures ready

## Security Controls

### Automated Security Scanning

Our platform includes automated security scanning at multiple levels:

#### Code Analysis

- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL and Semgrep for code quality and security
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit and Go vulnerability scanning
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog and GitLeaks for credential scanning
- **License Compliance**: Automated license compliance checking

#### Infrastructure Analysis

- **Infrastructure as Code**: tfsec and Checkov for Terraform security
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for container vulnerability scanning
- **Docker Security**: Hadolint for Dockerfile best practices
- **Network Analysis**: Automated network security validation

#### Runtime Security

- **Access Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of registry access
- **Anomaly Detection**: Behavioral analysis for unusual activities
- **Compliance Auditing**: Continuous compliance monitoring
- **Threat Detection**: Integration with Azure Security Center

### Security Automation

We use GitHub Actions for security automation:

- **Automated Scanning**: Security scans on every pull request
- **Vulnerability Alerts**: Automated alerts for new vulnerabilities
